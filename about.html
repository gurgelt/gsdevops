                <h1>What is <span style="color: blueviolet;">Yummy</span>?<br /></h1>
                <p>Yummy is a platform with the aim of getting into people's hearts so that they can show solidarity
                    with those who are hungry in the world or who have few conditions to feed themselves enough.
                    <br /><br />
                    With our platform, anyone who wants to help another can contact us explaining the situation of each
                    individual or community, which over time we will distribute the necessary food for them to be able
                    to eat.
                    <br /><br />
                    We will analyze each situation separately and as soon as it is concluded we will send an email
                    confirming the need that the person is experiencing so that we can then help them.
                    <br /><br />
                    We hope you help people around the world and spread love through gestures that make a <span
                        style="color: blueviolet;">difference</span>.
                    <br /><br />
